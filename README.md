*Sofware engineer with heavy experience building high traffic Internet sites and working with multicultural and interdisciplinary teams, working with people around the world using online tools to get the work done.*

I've been coding since 1990. I started with **Basic** on my PC AT 286 20MHZ, with 2MB RAM and 47MB HD. I made my first website in 1996, a riddle and puzzles website hosted on Geocities.

Building **Web3** applications since 2020, using **Scaffold-ETH**, **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, **Web3.js**, **Ethers.js**, among others.

I have experience coding in a lot of different languages, like **Pascal**, **C/C++**, **Java**, **PHP**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** and **Ruby**. I started using Ruby in 2006, when **RubyOnRails** was on the hype, and it's been my favorite web development language since then.

I usually prefer backend development but I also developed web sites and web applications from beginning to end (developing the backend, designing the frontend with **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** and **JavaScript/jQuery/Vue.js/React** for the UX). I like the design centered on usability (I enjoy reading Jakob Nielsen's books and articles).

I know about sysadmin, mainly **Ubuntu/Debian**. I used physical servers, virtual servers, **Heroku** and **Amazon AWS** services (S3, CloudFront, EC2, Route53, RDS, Lambda, DynamoDB).

I deeply know relational databases, mostly **MySQL and MariaDB**, and the performance tweaking to them. I also know NoSQL databases, like **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **CouchDB** and **Neo4j**.

Since the beginning of my professional career, I worked on support, IT security, sysadmin, development and CTO, having a wide experience and knowledge on IT areas.

I have experience in online marketing too. I managed **Adwords** campaigns buying more than 30M monthly clicks. I developed tools to automate online marketing tasks. Using the Adwords API and the monetization data from the sites, the tools optimize the campaigns and generate new keywords automatically. I also managed Facebook and Linkedin campaigns.

I enjoy doing **machine learning** and **data science** using **Python**. As a teacher at the University of Buenos Aires, I teach all these subjects to my students and they participate on Kaggle competitions as final works.

I'm open to learn new languages and technologies. I **like to learn new things** and I'm a **self learner**.
